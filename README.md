# NoSql-Challenge

For this challenge, we will use a Mongo database to evaluate food establishments in the UK for food magazine "Eat, Safe, Love". The analysis will help journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.  The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating.
